    "As the number of financial operations increases, so does the financial complexity. At first glance, it may sound good but increased financial transactions and complexity come with a cost. There are several tools to reduce this cost to a certain level. In finance literature, the effort of minimizing the cost is called `hedging`. Derivatives are primarily created as a tool for hedging. This is understandable as financial transactions are subject to various types of risk such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, political risk, and so on. Consequently, investors should find a way to hedge their investments, and derivatives serve this purpose."

    "We have discussed the essentials of derivative valuation and their applications in Python. As you may notice, there is a big difference in valuing a European option compared to an American option. The former option can be exercised only at maturity but the latter can be exercised at any time up to maturity. Therefore, we have a closed form solution for European options called the `Black-Scholes equation` and we adopt the binomial option pricing method for American options."
